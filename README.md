This project implements a simple IOT Application of a doorbell and a security system.
Minimum harsware is used:
1) Arduino uno board
2) Arduino Ethernet Shield
3) Push Button
4) PIR Motion Sensor

The project uses API of Pushingbox to send notification to the user.

Whenever the doorbell is pressed the system sends an email,tweet and a notification on the mobile of the user. 

The security system checks for any motion in the absence of the user and sends alerts based on any suspicious activity.
The data is stored in the cloud for later visualizations.
